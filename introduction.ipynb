    "* **Valid Characters**: Variable names can contain letters ```(a-z, A-Z)```, digits ```(0-9)```, and underscores ```(_)```. They **cannot** start with a digit. For instance, you can call a variable ```message_1``` but not ```1_message```.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No Special Characters**: Variable names should not include spaces or any special characters like ```!```, ```@```,``` #```,``` $```,``` %```, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Case-Sensitivity**: Python variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that variables with different letter cases are considered distinct. For example, ```name```, ```Name```, and ```NAME``` are three different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reserved Keywords**: Avoid using Python's reserved keywords as variable names, as they have predefined meanings in the language. Some examples of reserved keywords include ```if```, ```else```, ```while```, ```for```, ```def```, ```class```, ```import```, and ```True```.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Descriptive and Readable**: Choose descriptive and meaningful variable names that convey the purpose or content of the data they store. This improves the code's readability and makes it easier for others (and your future self) to understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Snake Case**: In Python, the convention for multi-word variable names is to use snake case, which involves writing all lowercase letters and separating words with underscores. For example, ```user_age```, ```item_list```, and ```total_count``` are all valid snake case variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Length Limitation**: While Python allows variable names of any length, it's advisable to keep them reasonably concise to avoid excessive typing and enhance code readability."
